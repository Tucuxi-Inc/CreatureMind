## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

**"Command not found" errors:**
- **Mac**: Make sure you installed Python with Homebrew
- **Windows**: Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- **All systems**: Try using `python3` instead of `python`

**"Permission denied" errors:**
```bash
# Try these alternatives in order:
python3 -m api.server
python3 -m uvicorn api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
sudo python3 -m api.server  # Last resort on Linux
```

**Package installation issues:**
```bash
# Try these alternatives:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Use a different port:
python3 -m uvicorn api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
# Then visit http://localhost:8001
```

### Common Usage Issues

**Activities showing mock responses:**
- Make sure you set your API key via the web interface
- Create a new creature after setting the API key
- Check that your creature template includes the activity you're trying

**Translation not working:**
- Check creature's happiness and energy levels
- Try feeding, petting, or playing to improve stats
- Some species are more independent and translate less frequently

**Creatures showing wrong behaviors:**
- Make sure you're using the correct species template
- Human creatures should use human actions, not animal behaviors
- Create a fresh creature if switching between very different species

**Stats not updating:**
- Check the creature status page to verify stats are actually changing
- Web interface may have display lag - stats update on the server immediately
- Try refreshing the browser page
